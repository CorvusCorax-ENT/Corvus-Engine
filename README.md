Corvus-Engine
=============

Corvus Engine is something i invisioned when i first saw google guice back in 2009. Its a single instance that holds dependencies and singletonians in a map and offers annotation processing. Its pretty crude and simple, thats intended. Don't see it of any use for others besides me, but if you find something that you can borrow from it feel free.
